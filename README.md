# Overview
 
This project transforms the New York Bike dataset, which contains data from 2014 to 2019. The dataset, comprising over 20 million rows, is processed using PySpark as the transformation tool. Data loading and transformation were performed to standardize dates and aggregate information according to reporting requirements. The transformed data is then loaded into a PostgreSQL database, which serves as the data source for the Looker Studio dashboard.
